<h1 class="mb-5">F.A.Q.</h1>
<P class="card-title">WHAT ARE YOUR COMMERCIAL RATES?</P>
<P>Please contact me with any inquiries for commercial work by using the contact form below.</P>
<P class="card-title pt-4">ARE YOUR COMMISSIONS OPEN?</P>
<P>My commissions are open on a rolling basis--I encourage you to drop me a line if you're interested in commissioning me, though I can't always guarantee my availability.</P>
<P class="card-title pt-4">WHAT ARE YOUR RATES FOR PERSONAL COMMISSIONS?</P>
<P>My rates vary depending on the complexity of the proposed project, but the basics for fully-rendered commissions are as follows:</P>
<div class="card-deck my-5">
    <div class="card" id="list-card">
        <div class="card-body text-center px-0">
            <p class="card-title">Full body</p>
            <h2 class="mb-0">$500</h2>
        </div>
    </div>  
    <div class="card" id="list-card">
        <div class="card-body text-center px-0">
            <p class="card-title">Waist-Up</p>
            <h2 class="mb-0">$350</h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card" id="list-card">
        <div class="card-body text-center px-0">
            <p class="card-title">Portrait</p>
            <h2 class="mb-0">$200</h2>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<P>All prices are per character. Commissions will be fully rendered and include a simple background (consisting of a color gradient and some textures) included in the cost! Adding a more elaborate background/setting for your illustration will come at an additional cost (determined by the complexity of the requested background).
It goes without saying that personal commissions are for <B>PERSONAL USE ONLY</B>--please send me a message if you're interested in hiring me for commercial work!</P>
<P>I retain all the rights to my work.</P>
<P>I will usually post a low-resolution, watermarked image of the completed commission on my social media accounts.</P>
<P class="card-title pt-4">DO YOU HAVE ANY TUTORIALS?</P>
<P>I have a few tutorials up on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heyitsjaki/">instagram</a>, <a href="http://itsmyfreakin.tumblr.com/tagged/tutorial">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/c/heyitsjaki">youtube</a>. If you have any questions about my process, feel free to drop me a line!</P>
